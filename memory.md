memory.py defines a function save_conversation_memory that takes a list of dialog tuples representing user input and model responses. It saves this conversation memory to a JSON file with a unique filename based on the current timestamp. The function also ensures the specified folder for memory storage exists and formats the memory as a list of dictionaries. The resulting JSON file captures the conversation history, which can be useful for analysis or future reference.
